# Customized GVSU Ares

---

These are the customized HTML files for our installation of Ares Course Reserve software. We've done extensive work in branding the application and customizing a lot of the crummy user interaction that Atlas Systems is never going to get around to. Hope this helps you as you work on improving your own Ares website!

## Features

* Streamlined add items functionality - one form that responds to whatever type of item you have (see [https://vimeo.com/53361712](https://vimeo.com/53361712) for a video walkthrough of this feature.)
* Empty tables are hidden, and prompts are added to help novice users add classes or items.
* Labels are made readable, forms are made accessible, and the whole experience is just better.
* Simplified manage account screen, since the largest source of errors were due to excessivly long forms required before you could use the dang website.
* There is no red text anywhere. None.
